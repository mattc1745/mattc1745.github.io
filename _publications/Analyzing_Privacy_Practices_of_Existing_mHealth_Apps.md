Given students’ reliance on smartphones and the popularity of mobile health apps, care should be taken to protect
students’ sensitive health information; one of the major potential risks of the disclosure of this data could
be discrimination by insurance companies and employers. We conducted an exploratory study of 197 existing
smartphone apps, which included 98 mobile health apps, to study their data collection, usage, sharing, storage
and deletion practices. We present our findings from the analysis of privacy policies and permission requests
of mHealth apps, and propose the need for a usable health data dashboard for users to better understand and
control how their health data is collected, used, shared and deleted.
